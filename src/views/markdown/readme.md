# README

My name is Alex Wilson. I am a US-BASED developer with an interest in all things related to math, science, engineering, and technology. I am especially interested in areas like automation, computer networking, cloud administration, cybersecurity, software development, and AI/ML applications. I am at my happiest when I am learning or feel like I am improving myself, whether through hitting the gym, learning Spanish through Duolingo, training my dogs, or working through HackTheBox. Sometimes I do need to "turn my brain off" and relax. When I do that, you will likely find me reading non-fiction or manga, watching anime, playing video games, ricing my Linux distro, creating 2D/3D art, or playing Yu-Gi-Oh. What can I say? I am a certified nerd.
