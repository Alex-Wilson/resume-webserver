# README

My name is Alex Wilson. I am a developer living in the U.S. who is passionate about a wide variety of topics related to STEM such as automation, machine learning, genetic algorithms, decentralized networking, encryption, cloud/container security, command and control, intrusion detection evasion, pharmacodynamics, energetic materials, machining, fabrication, complex system integration, esotericism, and memetics. I have a B.S. from Missouri State University in Computer Science, but my love of learning has led me to certifications in many different technologies; but I have learned mostly about myself. A list of my certifications can be found at [/certifications](/certifications).

I love challenging myself to improve every day by focusing on both my body and my mind. I challenge my body through physical exercise like lifting, swimming, and running and I challenge my mind through learning, studying, exploring, tinkering, and artistic expression. This independent focus strengthens both mind and body, fostering discipline and daily satisfaction. I also am obsessed with achieving [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) state.

To relax, I enjoy coding, reading, practicing my offensive security skills, playing video games, playing yu-gi-oh or poker, watching anime, ricing my linux distro, creating digital art, listening to music, cuddling with my dogs, and (most importantly) laughing.
