## About me
Hello, World! Welcome to alexwilson.info! If you could not tell, my name is Alex Wilson, and I am a self-proclaimed technologist. I have always been fascinated by science, technology, engineering, and math, but I find true fulfillment in leveraging computers to enhance my creativity, efficiency, and problem-solving skills. I enjoy the magic of automating repetitive tasks, the challenge of transforming abstract ideas into real-world solutions, and the freedom to create on my own terms.

As human society increasingly integrates computers into daily life, new opportunities emerge at the intersection of logic, creativity, and ingenuity. These opportunities are waiting to be explored and developed. I want to be prepared and employed to confront these challenges!

## Purpose
This website serves as a digital resume to showcase my projects, problem-solving skills, design acumen, and achievements, helping to increase my visibility and credibility within the tech community and among potential employers. I also want to share my knowledge with others, as I have found that explaining a concept is the best way to truly understand it myself.

## Career
For Christmas of 2010, my mom took me to MicroCenter and let me pick out parts for a budget desktop. After watching days’ worth of YouTube videos on my iTouch, I finally assembled it myself! I was so proud of getting my rig (Athlon X4, Radeon HD 5770, and a 256GB HDD (lol)) to POST. Once it was on   I realized my Steam library was empty, I had no video games to play.

Determined to find the best game, I scoured the internet and stumbled upon World of Warcraft. I needed this game, but I also needed serious money, $40 upfront and $15 per month. So I started researching ways to make money online and discovered Amazon Mechanical Turk, a platform that paid users to complete small puzzles, label data, and respond to surveys. That experience opened my eyes, and from that point on, I knew I wanted to work with computers professionally.

Later, a friend who ran a small business replacing iPhone screens told me he was leaving to work for a different company called "St. Louis Computer Service", where he knew the team. He suggested I apply as well, and soon I found myself handling hardware repairs, software troubleshooting, and small network setups. It was my first real job in IT, and it laid the foundation for everything that followed.

In 2018, while studying Computer Science at Missouri State, I landed an internship with Ameren, a Fortune 500 electricity and natural gas provider that serves most of Missouri. The team I joined was responsible for migrating users, their content, and their structure from SharePoint 2016, an on-premises system, to SharePoint Online in the cloud, all while ensuring minimal disruption for users.

From a technical standpoint, this process was fairly straightforward since multiple tools existed to handle migrations out of the box. However, I took on a less technical but equally critical role, coordinating with various business units to ensure the completion of pre-migration checklists, scheduling and tracking migration activities for both the business units and the technical team, facilitating question-and-answer sessions, communicating progress, and updating trackers.

In the summer of 2019, I had just graduated, and my second summer in the internship program was coming to an end. I was told there were no openings on the SharePoint Development team, but I was being recommended to apply for a position as a Project Manager.
