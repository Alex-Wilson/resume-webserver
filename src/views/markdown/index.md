# Hello, World!
Welcome to alexwilson.info! I'm Alex Wilson, a self-proclaimed technologist. I've always been fascinated by science, technology, engineering, and math, but I find the most fulfillment in using computers to enhance my creativity, efficiency, and problem-solving. 

I love converting abstract ideas into practical solutions, finding magic in automating repetitive tasks, feeling the satisfaction of solving complex problems, and enjoying the freedom to express myself digitally!

## Purpose
As computers become more ingrained in daily life, opportunities in technology and software development are expected to grow. This website serves as my digital resume, showcasing my projects, problem-solving skills, design acumen, and achievements to potential employers.

I also use this space to share knowledge, as Iâ€™ve found that teaching a concept is the best way to truly master it myself.


## Career Goals
My goal is to transition into a highly technical role where I can apply my skills in system, network, and cloud administration, security, devops, and software development. I want to work hands-on with infrastructure, automation, and security, solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies.

Long term, I aim to specialize in cybersecurity, exploit development, and  cloud security architecture. I am passionate about understanding systems at a deep level, improving security, and building reliable, scalable solutions.
