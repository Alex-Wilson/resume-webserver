# How Computers Work: A History and Review

## What is Computing?
The word "computing" comes from the Latin word "computare", "com-" meaning "together/with/completely" and "-putare" meaning "to prune/clear/settle/accounts/reckon". This word is first seen around 100 BCE in the writings of Cicero and Julius Caesar. The word was typically used how we might use the phrase "Someone accounted for something" or in reference to the human laborers who performed counting or manual calculations. Often times these laborers did not know the greater details or purpose of their counting/calulcations but they often used physical implements to help them. The term "computer" being used to describe human workers was common up until the late 1900s, when this work was incresingly replaced by consumer electronic computers.

So computing is just counting and calculations? 

A more vauge but more accurate description might be: computing is the use of a physical implementation (the computer) which assists humans to use mathematics (counting, calculation, processing, "computing") to describe physical or digital reality. 

# The Brain and Consiosuness
The first computer on earth was likely the organic brain. While brains are extremely complicated and have evolved gradually from simpler nerve nets in organisms like Jellyfish and Anemones it is clear that a brain takes in information (e.g. enviornmental conditions), performs operations (e.g. thinking), and then outputs actions or new information (e.g. action, inaction, potentially consiousness). This is what determines the behavior of the organism. 

The Cambrian Explosion is a mysterious series of events where there was an unprecedented and rapid diversification of multicellular life forms, such as the Fuxianhuia Protensa, an ancient relative to both insects, crabs, and lobsters which left the oldest known fossil of a brain (roughly 550-500 MYA), a small cavity filled with highly centralized nerve clusters connected to its eyes and antenna. While this is unlikely to be the first brain, it is our first evidence to support that nerves have been used to "process" or combine information from mutliple sensory organs.

To calm down any biologists, obviously the brain is very different from antique or modern computers and consciousness appears to emerge only from living beings. However, it is strikingly clear that the brain takes in information, processes it, and then comes up with some kind of output. This is not unique to humans. However, one thing that humans are very good at is abstraction.

# Abstract-ly!
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by focusing on the essential features and ignoring irrelevant details. It involves forming general concepts or ideas from specific instances. For example, when you see many different types of chairs (a stool, a beanbag, an armchair), your brain abstracts the core concept of "chair" (something to sit on) despite their varied appearances. In computing, abstraction allows us to manage complexity by building layers of simpler ideas on top of each other, like using words instead of individual letters. 

What is the point of abstraction? 

The primary point of abstraction is to manage complexity and enable understanding, communication, and problem-solving. In essence, abstraction is a fundamental cognitive tool that makes thought, language, and the creation of complex tools (like computers) possible. 

# B(one)s
Physical evidence of a computational aid was first discovered in 1960 by Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo when he found a small bone of a baboon with a series of deliberately carved notches grouped into various patterns. The bone is estimated to be 20,000 years ago.  Its precise purpose is still debated among archaeologists and mathematicians but it was likely used for a special case of counting or arithmetic operations. This is simmilar to the Lembombo Bone which was another bone found with markings dating almost 40,000 years ago but it is believed to be a more "simple case" of sequential counting. 

The true purpose may be elusive but it seems to be strong evidence that early humans expended effort to abstract numerical patterns and natural cycles from continuous reality and represent them in a discrete, tangible form.



# Revolution in Counting
Counting was important for prehistoric peoples, but as humans started farming with the agricultural revolution, it became even more crucial for managing crops, livestock, and trade. This is backed up by some of the earliest evidence of counting boards. The earliest forms of these boards, which can be seen as precursors to the abacus, emerged with the Sumerians around 2700-2300 BCE. These were essentially flat surfaces with lines or grooves on which pebbles or counters were moved. For example, when one row was filled, a single pebble would be moved to the next row up, effectively carrying over a value and resetting the row below. This systematic method is also strong evidence of early human understanding of a numerical base system.  

The true revolution brought by such computational aids was their ability to extend human cognitive limits. Many individuals operating these abacus-like devices could themselves not count large numbers unaided, yet with the abacus, they could easily perform calculations involving thousands and beyond. The device provided an abstract representation that allowed complex operations without requiring the operator to fully grasp the magnitude of the numbers directly.


# Astrolabe
Beyond simple counting and arithmetic, other early instruments emerged that allowed for more complex "computations" in specialized fields. One notable example is the astrolabe. First invented in Ancient Greece around 200 BCE, its design was later perfected and widely adopted in the Islamic world from the 8th century CE onwards. The astrolabe was a sophisticated handheld device used by sailors and astronomers to determine: the current time, local latitude, the positions of celestial objects for navigation, the time of sunrise or sunset, and even for surveying and triangulation. This is one of the first devices widely used that was fabricated with the explicit purpose of performing complex analog calculations. 

Crucially, just like the abacus, the astrolabe extended human capability by abstracting complex mathematical knowledge. A navigator or shipping company employee could be taught how to operate the astrolabe, following its manual, and successfully perform intricate astronomical calculations quickly, without needing to understand the underlying principles of trigonometry or celestial mechanics themselves.

# O'clock
Another pivotal invention that can be seen as an early form of analog computation is the mechanical clock. While its primary purpose wasn't to "calculate" in the arithmetic sense, it performed a continuous, sophisticated computation of time, a crucial abstraction of reality. Unlike the abacus or astrolabe which required human manipulation for each "calculation," early mechanical clocks were automated. They used a system of gears, weights, and escapements to consistently measure and display the passage of time. They literally "computed" the current time by continuously integrating the flow of time.

The word "automate" (and "automation") ultimately comes from the Ancient Greek word "automatos". "Autos" meaning "self" and "matos" meaning "thinking/willing/acting/striving/desiring". A modern equivalent is often said to be "spontaneous". This referred to something moving or performing by its own internal mechanism, without external manipulation or human intervention at the moment of action. At the time of the greeks this was commonly used to describe how seeds grow on their own or the wind blows on its own.  

The earliest verifiable mechanical clocks appeared in Europe in the late 13th and early 14th centuries CE. Clocks became increasingly sophisticated in the following centuries, leading to the development of highly accurate timekeeping mechanisms. The clock was one of the first truly automated and continuously operating analog computers. It performed a calculation (timekeeping) without constant human input.
