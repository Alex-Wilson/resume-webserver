# How Computers Work: A History and Review

## What is Computing?

The word "computing" comes from the Latin word "computare", "com-" meaning "together/with/completely" and "-putare" meaning "to prune/clear/settle/accounts/reckon". This word is first seen around 100 BCE in the writings of Cicero and Julius Caesar. The word was typically used how we might use the phrase "Someone accounted for something" or in reference to the human laborers who performed counting or manual calculations. Often times these laborers did not know the greater details or purpose of their counting/calulcations but they often used physical implements to help them. The term "computer" being used to describe human workers was common up until the late 1900s, when this work was incresingly replaced by consumer electronic computers.

So computing is just counting and calculations? 

While people were computers, we now think of a computer as a physical implementation which assists the use of mathematics upon items in physical or digital reality. This might seem vauge but lets look at some of the earliest devices humans used to assist with counting and calculation.
