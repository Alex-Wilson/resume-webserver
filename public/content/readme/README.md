# README
I am a developer living in the United States who loves to learn!

I have a Bachelor of Science in computer science from Missouri State University in Springfield, MO. I studied topics such as genetic algorithms, semi-supervised learning, computer vision, decentralized networking, and cryptography.

After graduation, I expanded my skills and learned about software engineering, web application security, cloud automation, cloud security, and network security. I have earned multiple [/certifications](/certifications), but preparing for these certifications has taught me more about myself than achieving them.

I love challenging myself and overcoming. I look to improve every day by focusing on my body and my mind independently. I challenge my body through physical exercise like lifting weights, swimming, and running.  I challenge my mind through discipline, creative expression, and continuous education. Focusing on these two distinct aspects has helped me to achieve my goals, feel satisfied, and occasionally achieve the euphoric [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

I teach myself about philosophy, symbolism, economics, history, design, evolutionary/micro/molecular biology, chemical kinetics, pharmacodynamics, material science, and additive manufacturing.

In my free time I maintain my home lab, make music, and create visual art. When I need to leave cyberspace, I take my dogs on a hike, fly my FPV drone at the park, play Yu-Gi-Oh at my local card shop, or collect samples for my microscope.

To relax, I enjoy cuddling with my dogs, spending time with loved ones, trying new foods, reading manga and non-fiction books, watching anime, and playing video games.
