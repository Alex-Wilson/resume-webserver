# README
I am a developer living in the United States. I have always loved learning new things and exploring wild ideas.

I have a Bachelor of Science in computer science from Missouri State University in Springfield, MO. I studied topics such as: genetic algorithms, semi-supervised learning, computer vision, decentralized networking, and cryptography.

After graduation, I expanded my skills to include software engineering best practices, containerization/virtualization, application security, cloud automation, cloud security, and network security. I have earned multiple [/certifications](/certifications) across a wide range of technologies, but preparing for these certifications has taught me more about myself than achieving them.

I love challenging myself to improve every day by focusing on my body and my mind independently. I challenge my body through physical exercise like lifting, swimming, and running, and I challenge my mind through continued education, discipline, and creative expression. Focusing on these as two distinct modes of the brain has helped me to achieve my goals, feel satisfied, and occasionally achieve the euphoric [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

I love learning to do things I wasnt taught in my formal education like cooking, making music, digital art, 


design, evolutionary biology, microbiology, molecular biology, microscopy, chemical kinetics, pharmacodynamics, additive manufacturing, and flying drones.

To relax, I enjoy reading manga and non-fiction books, watching anime, making video games, playing poker and Yu-Gi-Oh, cuddling with my dogs, spending time with loved ones, and trying new foods.
