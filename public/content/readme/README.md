Welcome to my site, my name is Alex Wilson. 

I live in the U.S. and I am passionate about learning! I fell in love with math the first time I isolated a variable in a linear equation. The realization that math could be "undone" to find an answer was awesome, in a biblical sense. Through high school I never understood my career options, but I knew I wanted to learn more about the intersection of my main academic interest, math, and my main hobby at the time, modding video games.

I chose to pursue a degree computer science at Missouri State University in Springfield, MO, where I found myself drawn to complex topics like genetic algorithms, semi-supervised learning, computer vision, decentralized networking, and cryptography.

After graduation, I expanded my interests to include more applicable (read "employable") skills, such as software engineering best practices, containerization/virtualization, application security, cloud automation, cloud security, and network security. I have earned many [/certifications](/certifications) across a wide range of technologies, but preparing for and conquering these certifications has taught me more about myself than anything else.

I continue to teach myself about a wide array of topics, such as guitar, digital art, design, evolutionary biology, microbiology, molecular biology, microscopy, chemical kinetics, pharmacodynamics, additive manufacturing, and flying drones.

I love challenging myself to improve every day by focusing on my body and my mind independently. I challenge my body through physical exercise like lifting, swimming, and running, and I challenge my mind through continued education, discipline, and creative expression. Focusing on these as two distinct modes of the brain has helped me to achieve my goals, feel satisfied, and occasionally achieve the euphoric [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

To relax, I enjoy reading manga and non-fiction books, watching YouTube documentaries and anime, playing video games, poker, and yugioh, listening to music, cuddling with my dogs, spending time with loved ones, and trying new foods.
