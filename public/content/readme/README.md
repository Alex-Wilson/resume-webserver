# README
My name is Alex Wilson, and I am a developer with a passion for learning.

In 2019, I graduated from Missouri State University in Springfield, MO with a Bachelor of Science in computer science, studying topics such as machine learning, networking, and cybersecurity.

After 5 years as a software project manager, I felt unfulfilled. I envied the developers that I worked with, as they had more responsibility, but they had agency, the respect of their peers, and trust of their leaders. This was earned, and at the advice of one of my coworkers, I decided to set forth and become the developer that I know I can be. 

I am using this site to track and exhibit my work and growth.

My love of science goes beyond math, and I love getting lost in rabbit holes related to evolutionary, micro, and molecular biology, chemical kinetics, pharmacodynamics, material science, and manufacturing.

It is also important to study things outside of STEM like economics, history, symbolism, philosophy, mythology, memetics, psychology, and design to truly appreciate language/culture and to express oneself creatively.

It is also important to study things outside of STEM like economics, history, symbolism, philosophy, mythology, memetics, psychology and design to better appreciate language/culture/experience and to express one's self creatively. 

If I can use my computer when I have free time, you will likely find me maintaining my home lab, creating visual art, making music, watching anime, reading books/manga, or playing video games.

When I find myself in the real world, I hope that I am spending time with my loved ones, playing poker or Yu-Gi-Oh, trying new foods, or connecting with nature. One of my favorite things is to take my dogs for a hike. Along the way, I will typically practice flying my drone or collect samples to look at under my microscope when we return. I am often reminded of the John Muir quote, "In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks."

I try to challenge myself mentally or physically every day, whether through lifting weights, running, and swimming; expressing myself creatively; doing something outside my comfort zone; or learning something new. I feel these challenges help me become a better person, achieve my goals, and feel satisfied with my life. I am always trying to achieve the euphoric [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).
