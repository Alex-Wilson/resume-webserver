# README
My name is Alex Wilson, and I am a developer with a passion for learning.

I attended Missouri State University in Springfield, MO where I earned a Bachelor of Science in computer science studying topics such as algorithm design, machine learning, networking, and cybersecurity. 

Math is my true love, but I also enjoy learning about other topics including philosophy, symbolism, economics, history, design, evolutionary/micro/molecular biology, chemical kinetics, pharmacodynamics, material science, and additive manufacturing.

All of this has prepared me to learn more about the topics I am most interested in like software engineering, exploit development, computer vision, semi-supervised learning, genetic algorithms, and infrastructure automation.

In my free time, I maintain my home lab, make music, and create visual art. When I need to leave cyberspace, I take my dogs for a hike, fly my FPV drone at the park, play Yu-Gi-Oh at my local card shop, or collect samples to look at under my microscope. To relax, I spend time with loved ones, try new foods, read manga and non-fiction books, watch anime, and play video games.

I try to challenge myself mentally or physically every day, whether through lifting weights, running, and swimming, expressing myself creatively, doing something outside my comfort zone, or learning something new. I feel these challenges help me become a better person, achieve my goals, and feel satisfied with my life. I am always trying to achieve the euphoric [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).
