# README
My name is Alex Wilson. I am a developer from the U.S. with a passion for learning about STEM. I fell in love with mathematics the first time I isolated a variable in a linear equation. The realization that math could be "undone" to find an answer was truly awesome, in the biblical sense. Through high school I never understood my career options, but I knew I wanted to learn more about the intersection of mathematics, computing, and the increasing digitalization of business. I went on to attend Missouri State University in Springfield, MO to study computer science. I found myself drawn to a variety of topics like mathematical optimization, algorithmic design, cryptography, genetic algorithms, machine learning, and computer vision.

After graduation, I expanded my interests to include more applicable (read "employable") skills such as software engineering best practices, containerization, virtualization, application security, cloud automation, cloud security, network security, decentralized networking, reverse engineering, malware analysis, exploit development, and intrusion detection evasion. I have earned many [/certifications](/certifications) across a wide range of technologies, but preparing for and conquering these certifications has taught me more about myself than anything else.

I still try to teach myself about topics not directly related to math like evolutionary biology, microbiology, molecular biology, chemical kinetics, pharmacodynamics, and additive manufacturing.

I love challenging myself to improve every day by focusing on my body and my mind independently. I challenge my body through physical exercise like lifting, swimming, and running, and I challenge my mind through continued education, discipline, and creative expression. Focusing on these as two distinct modes of the brain has helped me to achieve my goals, feel satisfied, and occasionally achieve the euphoric [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

To relax, I enjoy reading manga or non-fiction, watching YouTube videos or anime, playing video games or poker, building Yu-Gi-Oh decks (Tearlaments and Ryzeal GOATed), ricing my Linux distro, listening to music, cuddling with my dogs, and laughing with friends and family.
