# README

My name is Alex Wilson. I am a developer living in the U.S. with a passion for learning about all things related to STEM, but when I took my first discrete mathematics course at Missouri State University in Springfield, MO, I decided I wanted to learn about computer science. I am especially drawn to topics like mathematical optimization, algorithmic design, cryptography, genetic algorithms, machine learning, and computer vision. 

I also teach myself about topics not directly related to math, like evolutionary biology, microbiology, molecular biology, chemical kinetics, and pharmacodynamics.

After graduation, I expanded my interests to include more applicable (read "employable") skills such as software engineering best practices, application security, decentralized networking, network security, cloud automation/orchestration, cloud security, reverse engineering, malware analysis, exploit development, and intrusion detection evasion. I have earned many [/certifications](/certifications) across a wide range of technologies, but preparing for and conquering these certifications has taught me more about myself than anything else.

I love challenging myself to improve every day by focusing on my body and my mind independently. I challenge my body through physical exercise like lifting, swimming, and running, and I challenge my mind through learning, studying, exploring, tinkering, and expressing myself artistically. This method helps me to maintain my discipline, feel satisfied, and occasionally achieve [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

To relax, I enjoy coding, reading, practicing my offensive security skills, playing video games or poker, building Yu-Gi-Oh decks (Tearlaments and Ryzeal), watching anime, ricing my Linux distro, listening to music, creating digital art, cuddling with my dogs, spending time with friends and family, and (most importantly) laughing.
