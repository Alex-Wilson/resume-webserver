      h1 The Ancient and Early Origins of Computing
      p.subtitle From ancient tools to modern machines, the journey of computing has been shaped by brilliant minds.

      section
        h2 Ancient Beginnings
        p.
          The history of computing dates back thousands of years, beginning with simple tools like the 
          #[strong abacus], used for basic arithmetic in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China. 
          These early devices laid the foundation for the concept of computation.

        h2 The 19th Century: Mechanical Computing
        p.
          The 19th century saw the rise of mechanical computing devices, thanks to pioneers like 
          #[strong Charles Babbage]. Babbage designed the 
          #[strong Difference Engine] and the 
          #[strong Analytical Engine], which were early mechanical computers capable of performing complex calculations. 
          Although never fully built during his lifetime, Babbage's designs inspired future generations of computing.

      section
        h2 Boolean Logic: The Foundation of Modern Computing
        p.
          In the mid-19th century, mathematician 
          #[strong George Boole] developed 
          #[strong Boolean algebra], a system of logic that uses binary values (true/false, 1/0) to represent logical operations. 
          Boole's work became the cornerstone of digital circuit design and programming, enabling the development of modern computers.

      section
        h2 The 20th Century: Alan Turing and the Birth of Computer Science
        p.
          In the 20th century, 
          #[strong Alan Turing] emerged as one of the most influential figures in computing. Turing formalized the concept of algorithms and computation with his theoretical 
          #[strong Turing Machine], a model that could simulate any computer algorithm. 
          During World War II, Turing played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code, showcasing the practical power of computing. 
          His work laid the groundwork for artificial intelligence and modern computer science.

      section
        h2 Conclusion
        p.
          From ancient tools to the visionary ideas of Boole, Babbage, and Turing, the origins of computing are a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. 
          These pioneers paved the way for the digital revolution that continues to shape our world today.
